# Weekend Challenge 4: Gallery of My Life

**Original Assignment Directions:** This weekend's application will be a gallery of 6 or more pictures of significance to you. When someone clicks on a picture, they should see a brief synopsis of why you chose to display that photo. Users can also heart/thumbs up/favorite your photo as many times as they want; you'll need to keep track of how many times it was clicked.

    *Hard Mode:*  Create a form that will take comments for each of your photos. Display the comments when a "Show Comments" button is clicked.

    *Pro Mode:*  Use Angular's $http service to store new data on the server. Try and deploy your site to Heroku. 

    Tech Used: Angular.js, Node/Express, HTML

**Updates:** Original submission date of this assignment was on 9/22/2017. The code for the original submition can be found on the "original" branch. Master branch contains the most recent updates I made after the submission date. My hope is that comparison of the two branches will illustrate the progress I have made on my coding skills between the original date of submission and the date of the most recent commit.

    Tech/files added on most recent commit:   readme, Bootstrap
